# StopForumSpam
DokuWiki plugin to use the Stop Forum Spam service

Checks user registration and Discussion posts.

## Usage

Because remote calls are somewhat heavy weight, it would be a good
idea to also install the Bad Behavior plugin.  This plugin runs
earlier in the processs and will stop a lot of spam before it ever
reaches this plugin.
